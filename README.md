P2Rank online is a web frontend for [p2rank] a protein-ligand binding site prediction tool based on machine learning.

You can [run p2rank on your computer using Docker](https://github.com/cusbg/p2rank-framework/wiki/P2Rank-Deploy-Docker) that way you have access to the same functionality as prankweb.

More information about [p2rank] and prankweb can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/cusbg/p2rank-framework/wiki).
